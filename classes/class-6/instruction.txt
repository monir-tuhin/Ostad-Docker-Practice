=================================
-- We can add '.dockerignore' file to define ignore files and folder of the repo. It is like '.gitignore'
-- PORT=3000 npm start : If port not define in the app then give port in the cmd during run the app
-- How to change env variable during docker run
       - docker run --rm -it -p 3000:4000 -e PORT=4000 monirzaman/node-docker-img
-- Here docker file
        FROM node:21-alpine
        ENV PORT=3000
        COPY package*.json .
        RUN npm i
        COPY . .
        CMD ["npm", "start"]

-- Here in docker file ENV port is 3000 but we can change env variable during running the container
